## dict.OrderedDict
# An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted.
# The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:
# OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. 
# A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order, and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. 
# By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.
