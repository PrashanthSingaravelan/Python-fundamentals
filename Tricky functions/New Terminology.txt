1) end=" " is just to say that you want a space after the end of the statement instead of a new line character.
By default python's print() ends with a new line.
if you put end=" " at the end of the print() then the curso remains in the same line itself.
Eg : 
print("Welcome to" , end = ' ')  
print("GeeksforGeeks", end = ' ') 

Output => Welcome to GeeksforGeeks 

2) print() : This is used instead print("\n")
